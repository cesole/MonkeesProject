# The Monkees
Built by **_Cecilia Barriga_**

>This website is a milestone project for Code institute. The aim of this webpage is to target fans of the group that wish to listen to their favorite tunes as well as being informed of new material coming out; but also to attrack new potentiel listeners.

## UX
> Users have access to their most famous albums, and a link to their spotify page so they can listen any album they wish to listen to. Regarding videos, they will be able to find the most played videos, and all the links to their social media, including youtube, in case they wish to see more videos and/or info about them. <br>
They will also be able to see what new materials might be coming out as well as the dates of their upcoming tours. <br>
In case they wish to have The Monkees playing at their event, they have a contact form in order to send their request.<br>
And finally, they will find some information of the band and their band members. I pair this with their picture, for user to identify easily each member.

## Features
>The website is composed of 4 pages:

1. [Home page](https://band-project-cbarriga.c9users.io/index.html): front page of the site where users can play 4 of the most played songs, also the latest materials and finally publicise their availability to perform at events with a button that link to the contact page.
2. [About page](https://band-project-cbarriga.c9users.io/about.html): background of the band and its members.
3. [Media page](https://band-project-cbarriga.c9users.io/media.html): there is a list of the best spotify albums, and a link to their spotify page. Also the users will find the 2 most played videos.
4. [Contact page](https://band-project-cbarriga.c9users.io/index.html): where the band can be booked for any type of events.

>Each page has a nav and a footer:
1. Nav: has a link to each page that toggles for smaller devices.
2. footer: has all the social links of the band inluding "The Monkees" Youtube page.
